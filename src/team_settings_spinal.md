## Here\'s a little bit about company settings

## H2

### H3

#### H4

1.  numbered list 1

2.  two

    1.  indented in list?

        1.  Another indent?

        ^

3.  three

4.  working at all?

* Unordered list

  * indent in unordered list?

  ^

* another

* and another

* working?

I don’t see a difference between H3 and H4. Ah, I see it now after it\'s published. It\'s slight.Now, I\'m not sure how to add images… Maybe we have to set up where the images will be stored in GitHub

Maybe I just set it up? Test below![Super Okay AV](src/images/Super%20Okay%20logo.png)

I edited to toolbar in Spinal\'s settings to include image, but I don\'t see it in the toolbar.
