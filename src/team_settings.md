## Here\'s a little bit about team settings

## H2

### H3

#### H4

1.  numbered list 1

2.  two

3.  three

4.  working at all?

* Unordered list

* another

* and another

* working?

I don’t see a difference between H3 and H4. Ah, I see it now after it\'s published. It\'s slight.Now, I\'m not sure how to add images… Maybe we have to set up where the images will be stored in GitHub

I edited to toolbar in Spinal\'s settings to include image, but I don\'t see it in the toolbar.

Here is a video. Does it work?
