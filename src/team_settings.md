## Here\'s a little bit about team settings

## H2

### H3

#### H4

1.  numbered list 1

2.  two

3.  three

4.  working at all?

* Unordered list

* another

* and another

* working?

I donâ€™t see a difference between H3 and H4. Ah, I see it now after it\'s published. It\'s slight.Now, I\'m not sure how to add images... Maybe we have to set up where the images will be stored in GitHub

I edited to toolbar in Spinal\'s settings to include image, but I don\'t see it in the toolbar.

Here is a video. Does it work?

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/876973379?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;quality_selector=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Dispatch 2 - Oct 22, 2023"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

#### This CMS Rich-text editor is a little difficult to work with. It\'s a tad finicky when it comes to spacing. Sometimes it will give me a few spaces lines between the next paragraph, even though I saved it with one space between lines.
