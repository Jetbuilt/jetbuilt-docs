## Here\'s a little bit about company settings

## H2

### H3

#### H4

1.  numbered list 1

2.  two

3.  three

4.  working at all?

* Unordered list

* another

* and another

* working?

#### I donâ€™t see a difference between H3 and H4. 

I can\'t get rid of this H4...Got it!Now, I\'m not sure how to add images... Maybe we have to set up where the images will be stored in GitHub

I edited to toolbar in Spinal\'s settings to include image, but I don\'t see it in the toolbar.

#### This CMS Rich-text editor is a little difficult to work with. It\'s a tad finicky.
